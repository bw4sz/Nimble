# Using and customizing MCMC in NIMBLE

1.) The file `litters.R` provides BUGS code and data/constants/initial values for a hierarchical model for survival data for rat pups in a simple experiment with a treatment and a control. 

There are ```G=2``` groups of rat litters, with ```N=16```  litters (i.e., mothers) in each group, and a variable number of pups in each litter. Survival of the pups in a litter is governed by a survival probability for each litter, ```p[i,j]```, but the probabilities for the litters within a group are considered to come from a common distribution, ```p[i,j] ~ dbeta(a[i], b[i])```, thereby borrowing strength across the litters in a group.

  - Examine the BUGS code and assess whether you understand the model structure (and ask me if you don't).
  - Run an MCMC for this model. 
  - Assess how it performs. If it doesn't perform well, what aspects of the model structure might be causing problems.  
  - Try to customize the MCMC (feel free to ask me for hints).

2.) Alternatively, experiment more with the MCMC for the state space model. You might try slice samplers for the variance parameters. 

3.) (Advanced) Can you figure out how to reparameterize the state space model so that one doesn't have parameters such as `r[t]` that have many dependent nodes?

# Operating a model

4.) Experiment with different values for the top-level (hyperparameter) nodes in the state-space model, simulating values for the true and observed population sizes over time given hyperparameter values that you choose. Plot these sizes to get a better understanding of how the hyperparameters determine population growth. 

Note that to simulate into data nodes, you'll need to use the *includeData* argument when calling the *simulate* method. Otherwise, by default NIMBLE will not overwrite data values.

# Compiling R code

5.) Let's consider using a nimbleFunction to replace a for loop that can't be (easily) avoided in R. Write a second order random walk using a nimbleFunction. Here's the code for the R version. 

```{r, markov-exer, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(0)
n <- 1e6
path <- rep(0, n)
rho1 <- .8
rho2 <- .1
path[1:2] <- rnorm(2)
print(system.time(
for(i in 3:n)
      path[i] <- rho1*path[i-1] + rho2*path[i-2] + rnorm(1)
))
nplot <- 5000
plot(seq_len(nplot), path[seq_len(nplot)], type = 'l', xlab = 'time')
```

Now fill out the nimbleFunction version and test the timing.

```{r, markov-exer-scaffold, eval=FALSE}
mc <- nimbleFunction(
   run = function( ... ) ) {
       returnType( ... )
       ...
       return(...)
})
cmc <- compileNimble(mc)
set.seed(0)
system.time(path <- cmc(n, rho1, rho2))
```

# Using nimbleFunctions

6.) User-defined distributions: Write an "IID normal" distribution that can be used for a vector of $n$ normally distributed random variables, $y_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$. Compare the speed of an MCMC based on using a for loop and *dnorm* in BUGS code to that based on using the user-defined distribution. When using the standard specification, make sure the MCMC does not use conjugate (Gibbs) sampling so results are comparable (you can set `useConjugacy=FALSE` in *configureMCMC()*). This makes for an apples to apples comparison since our MCMC system won't know how to use your IID normal distribution for conjugate updates. 

7.) User-defined MCMC samplers: Write a user-defined sampler that modifies NIMBLE's default Metropolis (*sampler_RW()*) sampler to use a gamma proposal distribution and includes the ratio of the proposal distributions (the Hastings adjustment) for a non-symmetric proposal distribution. Have your proposal centered on the mean of the gamma distribution. When you call *rgamma* in the run function, you'll want to use the {mean, sd} alternative parameterization of the  gamma distribution.

# Solution to Problem 5

```{r, solution, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(0)
n <- 1e6
path <- rep(0, n)
rho1 <- .8
rho2 <- .1
path[1:2] <- rnorm(2)
print(system.time(
for(i in 3:n)
      path[i] <- rho1*path[i-1] + rho2*path[i-2] + rnorm(1)
))
nplot <- 5000
plot(seq_len(nplot), path[seq_len(nplot)], type = 'l', xlab = 'time')


library(nimble)
mc <- nimbleFunction(
   run = function(n = double(0), rho1 = double(0), rho2 = double(0)) {
       returnType(double(1))
       path <- numeric(n, init = FALSE)
       path[1] <- rnorm(1)
       path[2] <- rnorm(1)
       for(i in 3:n) 
             path[i] <- rho1*path[i-1] + rho2*path[i-2] + rnorm(1)
       return(path)
})
cmc <- compileNimble(mc)
set.seed(0)
system.time(path <- cmc(n, rho1, rho2))
```

You should see that going to C++ gives us a speedup of approximately 40-fold.
